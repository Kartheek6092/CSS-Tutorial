This is a finest repository of CSS programs from basic to a standard level.

CSS-SELECTORS
=============
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

*Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
*Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
*Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
*Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
*Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
I have provided simple class selectors with practice code.

How to add CSS
==============
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

*External CSS
*Internal CSS
*Inline CSS
provided practice code for these three insertion types.

CSS Comments
============
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.
Comments are ignored by browsers.
A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */:
 provided practice code for comments.

CSS Setting height and width
============================
The height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins. It sets the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.

CSS height and width Values
===========================
The height and width properties may have the following values:

auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
length - Defines the height/width in px, cm etc.
% - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block
initial - Sets the height/width to its default value
inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value

CSS margins
===========
Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

Margin - Individual Sides
--------------------------
CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
All the margin properties can have the following values:

auto - the browser calculates the margin
length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
