CSS-SELECTORS
=============
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

*Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
*Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
*Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
*Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
*Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
I have provided simple class selectors with practice code.

How to add CSS
==============
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

*External CSS
*Internal CSS
*Inline CSS
provided practice code for these three insertion types.

CSS Comments
============
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.
Comments are ignored by browsers.
A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */:

CSS Setting height and width

The height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins. It sets the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.
